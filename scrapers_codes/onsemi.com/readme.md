Make sure you have properly followed the steps in [readme.md](/readme.md)

Run the program using command:
```
> python scraper.py 
```
Results will be saved into [results_data_frames/onsemi.com](/results_data_frames/onsemi.com) named as products.json.

If you want to specify output file path, you can use the command as:
```
> python scraper.py <path to output json file>
```
You can use `CTRL + C` if you want to stop program without finishing with all URLs. You will get the data that was scraped till that time.
